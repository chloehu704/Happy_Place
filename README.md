<p>A common theme we found in our research was that underrepresented college students were particularly impacted by mental health challenges. Relative to their counterparts, more underrepresented college students were struggling with mental health issues. We believe it’s essential to provide a platform better equipped with a more specialized set of resources to help them overcome these issues. Additionally, current resources are lacking and inaccessible because of various barriers. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health resources accessible to students have been decreasing in spite of a rising rate of college students with mental health issues. With adequate ways to access and receive help dwindling, we wish to take it upon ourselves to create a free and accessible method of overcoming mental health struggles. This made us wonder:</p>
<p>*How might we provide underrepresented students at UW access to specialized mental health resources in order to overcome their mental health struggles?*</p>
<p> To address this problem, we came up with *Happy Place*!</p>
Happy Place is an application that allows underrepresented students at the University of Washington to access quality mental health care by providing them with an outlet through a journal. This journal allows them to express their feelings and concerns and prompts them with questions through a guided questionnaire. Once the user answers the questions, happy place makes recommendations to try and help the user. The recommendations range from simple breathing exercises to suggesting that they see a school counselor. </p>
